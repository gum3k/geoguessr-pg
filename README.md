# Setup Guide

## Steps to Launch the Server

1. **Execute `server_launch.bat`**  
   Simply double-click on the `server_launch.bat` file. This will start the server and prepare everything for you. The website will be available at [http://localhost:8000/website/](http://localhost:8000/website/), which should open automatically.

2. **Enter Your Valid Google Cloud API Key**
   - **Maps JavaScript API**: Used to load locations on the website.
   - **Street View Static API**: Used during map generation to check for Street View coverage.

3. **That's It!**  
   Lmao I'm just too good.

## Important Notes

- Your **API key** is securely stored in the `apikey.txt` file, which is **ignored by Git**.
- The APIs in use **should not generate any costs**. However, it's recommended to check the limits and payment settings in your Google Cloud account for peace of mind.
- If you'd like to modify or update your API key, just follow the instructions when prompted by the script.

Enjoy the smooth setup and let the server work its magic! âœ¨
